PARAMS may contain an (:op . OPERATION) element.  If it does, use
string OPERATION to decide what to do with the code block.  Valid
options are:

  \"send\": Send the HTTP request specified in the source block.
  \"send get-headers\": Send the HTTP request specified in the source
    block, but only return the response headers.
  \"send get-body\": Send the HTTP request specified in the source
    block, but only return the response body.
  \"export curl\": Export request spec to curl format.
  \"export verb\": Export request spec to verb format.

The default value for OPERATION is \"send\"."
