  "List of content type handlers.
Handlers are functions to be called without any arguments.  There are
two types of handlers: text and binary.

Text handlers are called after the text contents of the response have
been decoded into a multibyte buffer (with that buffer as the current
buffer).

Binary handlers, on the other hand, are called after the binary
contents of the response have been inserted into a unibyte buffer
\(with that buffer as the current buffer).

Both handler types should prepare the contents of the response buffer,
so that the user can then access or modify the information received in
a convenient way.

Entries of the alist must have the form (CONTENT-TYPE HANDLER BIN?).
CONTENT-TYPE must be a regexp which can match any number of valid
content types, or a string containing a content type.  HANDLER must be
a function that takes no arguments.  BIN?, if present, must be t, in
order to indicate that this handler is binary instead of text.

To choose a handler, Verb will try to match the received content type
with each CONTENT-TYPE in the alist (sequentially) using
`string-match-p'.  The handler for the first CONTENT-TYPE to match
will be used."

  "Create and return a request specification from string TEXT.

The text format for request specifications is the following:

[COMMENT]...
METHOD [URL]
[HEADER]...

[BODY]

Each COMMENT must start with \"#\" or \":\" (see Org mode comments and
headline property syntax).  All comments will be discarded after being
read (they are not part of the returned value).  COMMENT may also be a
blank line.

METHOD must be a method matched by `verb--http-methods-regexp' (that
is, an HTTP method or the value of `verb--template-keyword').
Matching is case-insensitive.

URL must be a full URL, or a part of it.  If present, the scheme must
be \"http\" or \"https\".  If the scheme is not present, the URL will
be interpreted as a path, plus (if present) query string and fragment.
Therefore, using just \"example.org\" (note no scheme present) as URL
will result in a URL with its path set to \"example.org\", not as its
host.  URL may end in a backslash, in which case the following line
will be appended to it (ignoring its leading whitespace).  The process
is repeated as long as the current line ends with a backslash.

Each HEADER must be in the form of KEY: VALUE.  KEY must be a nonempty
string, VALUE can be the empty string.  HEADER may also start with
\"#\", in which case it will be ignored.

BODY can contain arbitrary data.  Note that there must be a blank
line between the HEADER list and BODY.  If BODY contains a properly
formatted Babel source block, the block beginning and end lines will
be removed.

As a special case, if the text specification consists exclusively of
comments and/or whitespace, or is the empty string, signal
`verb-empty-spec'.

If TEXT does not conform to the request specification text format,
signal an error.

Before returning the request specification, set its metadata to
